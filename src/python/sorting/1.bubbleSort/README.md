# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Complexity

| Case    | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Best    | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Average | O(n²)          | O(1)             |
| Worst   | O(n²)          | O(1)             |

## How it Works

1. Compare adjacent elements
2. Swap if they are in wrong order
3. Repeat until no swaps are needed

## When to Use

- Educational purposes
- Small datasets
- Nearly sorted data (with early exit optimization)
